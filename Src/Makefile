# Makefile for the whole project.
#
# Usage:
#   Run one of the following commands on the same directory as this file:
#     Make
#     Make everything
#       Configures ready for building, builds executable (resource and pascal)
#       Cleans up and creates release files
#     Make config
#       Configure source directories and creates binary output directories
#     Make exe
#     Make all
#       Builds both executables: same as Make res followed by Make pascal
#     Make res
#       Builds all resources.
#     Make pascal
#     Make pas
#       Builds all pascal files. Requires resources to have been built.
#     Make clean
#     Make tidy
#       Cleans up temporary files.
#     Make deepclean
#       Remove temorary files as per clean target along with generated .cfg
#       files and Build directory and its contents.
#     Make release
#       Creates binary release file.
