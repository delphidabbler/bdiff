  { Some uses of *size_t in original C code actually reference an array of
    size_t and are referenced using array[] notation. The following types are
    declared to use in these circumstances to enable similar notation in
    Pascal }

  { The original C code refers to the buffered file contents as an array of
    Char. The fact that Char is signed in C (-127..128) and unsigned in Pascal
    (0..255) means that the block sort algorithm and string lookup functions
    operate differently in C and Pascal. We therefore define a signed *ansi*
    char type - SignedAnsiChar - of the correct range and refer to the buffered
    file contents as an array of this new type. Since ShortInt is defined as
    (-127..128) we use this as the basis for SignedAnsiChar}
