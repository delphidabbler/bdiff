# BPatch

## Precis

BPatch applies a binary batch to a file.

## Synopsis

    bpatch [options] old-file [ new-file ] [<patch-file]

## Description

BPatch applies a binary patch generated by BDiff. Patches are read from standard input unless shell redirection is used or the `--input option` is used to specify an input file.

`old-file` should be the same file as used as the first argument to BDiff when generating the patch. BPatch will create a copy of the file given as second argument to BDiff in `new-file` by using the information from `old-file` and `patch-file`.

If `new-file` is omitted, the `old-file` is replaced with the new file.

BPatch will detect if the patch does not match old-file, or if the patch has been garbled. Remember to transmit binary patches as binary files!

In case of an error, `new-file` will not be touched.

## Options

| Short option    | Long option          | Description |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| `-i PATCH-FILE` | `--input=PATCH-FILE` | Read patch from specified file instead of standard input. Specifying `--input=-` does nothing. Use as an alternative to shell redirection. |
|`-h`             |  `--help`            | Show help screen and exit. |
|`-v`             |  `--version`         | Show version number and exit. |
